This section covers the creation and submission of batch scripts for "traditional" HPC workloads, for example multi-threaded code using OpenMP within a single compute node or MPI applications which execute accross multiple compute nodes. Example submission scripts for computations using a GPU are also given.

The advanced topics section describes how Sulis can be used to execute high throughput or ensemble computing workloads which consist of many replicas of serial, MPI or OpenMP calculations which may also involve GPUs.
