# Connecting to Sulis

Interactive access to Sulis can be achieved via a [Secure Shell (or SSH)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell_Protocol) client. Data may additionally be transferred to or from Sulis using SSH.

Two-factor authentication is enabled on Sulis meaning that two forms of identication are required to authenticate your access. These two forms of identification are:

* An SSH keypair protected by a passphrase.
* A [Time-based One-Time Password (or TOTP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_One-Time_Password).
